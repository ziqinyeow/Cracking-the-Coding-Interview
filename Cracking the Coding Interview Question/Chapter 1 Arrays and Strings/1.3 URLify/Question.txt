Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end
to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the
"true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in
Java, please ise a character array so that you can perform
this operation in place.)


Example
Input: "Mr John Smith           "
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
