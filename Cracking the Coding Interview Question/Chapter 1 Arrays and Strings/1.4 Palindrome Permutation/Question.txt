Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation
of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same
forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
The palindrome does not neeed to be limited to just dictionary words.

Example
Input: Tact Coa
Output: true (Permutation: "taco cat", will return true if at least
one permutation of the input is palindrome)

Explanation:
We should return true of the permutation of the input is a palindrome

Through the input case, we can see that this question is non case
sensitive. I figured out a solution that is to check the character should 
exist even times and only one character can exist in odd times

for example,
abccba == All the character exist even times which is true palindrome
abcdcba == All the character exist even times except 'd' which is
also true palindrome

I derive a O(N) solution which is to check if each of the character
exists in the string
